LaTeX is a powerful typsetting language, capable of creating gorgeous, production-quality documents.

But many journals require a simpler, more standard manuscript submission format, with Times New Roman font, 12 pt font size, 1 inch margins, and double spaced lines, and a particular reference style, etc. In addition, in double-blind review processes, cover pages with author names are used, but articles are often sent to reviewers without mention of authors names.
  
For both reviewers, and collaborators/commenters, a slightly less beautiful, but more spacious and legible format is often preferable in the pre-publication stage. Furthermore, when beginning the drafting process, researchers often do not know precisely to which journal they will submit their manuscript.
  
This general template aims to fill this ambiguous space, and serve as an advanced, feature-filled, place-holder template during the drafting and submission process. It is a general academic article manuscript template, which can easily be adapted to the exact specifications of any journal's manuscript submission guidelines.
  
The current settings are formatted for the American Journal of Sociology Guidelines as of November 2014, located here: http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/ajs/instruct.html?journal=ajs

The template also contains a number of packages and demonstrations useful for the drafting phase, including draft watermarks, inline and margin comments, text highlighting, underlining, and strike-through, and word count.
  
Finally, because of the detailed comments throughout, it may also be suitable as a template for those just learning LaTeX.

NOTES:
        
	(1) This template uses bibtex for citation and reference generation. This is primarily because the two Sociology citation styles included, (ASR and AJS) are only available in .bst format. Code is also provided if the user wishes to switch to biblatex and use a different style.
